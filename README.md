# BITS Goa: Inventory & Resource Scheduler (IRS) 🎓

A centralized, highly scalable, and fully-normalized database management system designed specifically for the BITS Pilani Goa Campus ecosystem. IRS allows campus clubs, departments, and faculty to seamlessly book resources (rooms, equipment, AV gear), manage organizational budgets, and eliminate scheduling conflicts through strict database-level concurrency controls and an AI-driven predictive agent.

## 👥 The Team & Roles

This system was developed by a 7-person team, with responsibilities distributed across a unified technical stack. 

| Member | Role | Core Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vishwam** | Backend Lead | RESTful API architecture using Node.js and Express. |
| **Kavya** | Frontend Lead | React (Vite) UI/UX, responsive booking calendar, and dashboard. |
| **Tanishq** | Database Architect | 10-table 3NF schema design, constraints, and data integrity. |
| **Aadi** | Concurrency Specialist | PL/pgSQL triggers and transaction isolation to prevent double-bookings. |
| **Arth** | Auth & Security Lead | JWT authentication, middleware (`verifyToken`), and Role-Based Access Control. |
| **Shreyas** | Finance Module Lead | SQL budget tracking, automated fine calculations, and Chart.js visualization. |
| **Haider** | AI & DevOps Lead | Docker containerization, Nginx reverse proxy, and Python AI Agent deployment. |

## 🚀 Local Setup & Installation

The entire infrastructure is Dockerized, allowing the full stack to spin up with a single command. 

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Ports `80` (Nginx), `5432` (Postgres), `3000` (Node), and `8000` (Python) available.

### Step 1: Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

    POSTGRES_USER=irsadmin
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=irspassword
    POSTGRES_DB=irsdb

### Step 2: Build & Deploy
Run the following command in the root directory:

    docker-compose up -d --build

*Note: On the first initialization, the `db` container will automatically execute `schema.sql` and `seed.sql` to initialize the database with tables, triggers, and mock data.*

### Step 3: Access the Application
* **Frontend UI (React):** http://localhost:80
* **Backend API (Node):** http://localhost/api/
* **AI Agent:** http://localhost:8000
* **Database:** localhost:5432

## 🏃‍♂️ Team Workflow: The MVP Sprint Protocol

To get the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) running efficiently, the team follows this parallel integration workflow:

### 1. Database & Infra Initialization (Haider & Tanishq)
* **Haider:** Spins up the live PostgreSQL database (via Supabase, Neon, or local Docker) and shares the `DATABASE_URL` with the team.
* **Tanishq:** Executes `schema.sql` to build the 10-table 3NF schema, followed by `seed.sql` to populate the database with dummy BITS Goa clubs, users, and resources. 

### 2. API & Security Layer (Vishwam & Arth)
* **Vishwam:** Initializes the Node/Express server and connects to the database using the provided URL. Builds the core `GET /api/resources` and `POST /api/bookings` endpoints.
* **Arth:** Builds the `POST /api/login` route to issue JWTs based on the `users` table. Applies the `verifyToken` middleware to Vishwam's booking routes to enforce Role-Based Access Control.

### 3. Frontend Dashboard (Kavya)
* Initializes the Vite/React app and sets up Tailwind CSS.
* Builds the UI components (Login Screen, Resource Grid) using temporary dummy data.
* Integrates `fetch()` calls to Vishwam's `GET /api/resources` endpoint to make the dashboard dynamically render the live database inventory.

### 4. Concurrency & Finance Triggers (Aadi & Shreyas)
* **Aadi:** Connects directly to the database to write the `BEFORE INSERT` trigger on the `bookings` table. This trigger checks the requested `start_time` and `end_time` against existing approved bookings to block overlapping schedules.
* **Shreyas:** Writes the SQL functions to calculate booking costs (`hourly_rate` * duration) and creates the trigger to deduct `total_cost` from the `current_balance` in the `clubs` table upon booking completion.

## ✨ Core Technical Highlights

### Advanced Database Architecture
* **3NF Normalization:** A robust separation of Independent entities (Roles, Departments, Clubs) from Dependent entities (Users, Resources, Bookings) to eliminate data redundancy.
* **Zero Double-Bookings:** Strict transaction isolation utilizing PostgreSQL's `OVERLAPS` function guarantees zero scheduling conflicts.
* **Automated Accountability:** `finance-logic.sql` automates late return penalties and usage fees using `EXTRACT(EPOCH...)` directly at the database layer.

### Microservices & AI Integration
* **Containerized Deployment:** Seamless orchestration of DB, Backend, Frontend, and AI layers behind an Nginx reverse proxy.
* **Predictive "Smart Clerk":** A dedicated Python service designed to analyze historical booking trends and forecast resource crunches during major college fests.
